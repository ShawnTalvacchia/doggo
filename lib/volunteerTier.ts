/**
 * volunteerTier.ts — cross-shelter volunteer tier resolution + mentor
 * helpers (Cross-Shelter Mentor Network, 2026-06-09).
 *
 * Per-shelter tiers (vetted / experienced / trusted) stay per-shelter —
 * they gate what a walker may do at THAT shelter. The platform-level
 * **Super Volunteer** tier is the portable credential layered on top:
 * recognized at every participating shelter, it's what unlocks offering
 * mentor sessions and what a new shelter sees on an incoming application
 * ("Super Volunteer · 87 walks at Útulek · …").
 *
 * Demo resolution rule: platform Super Volunteer = cross-shelter walk
 * total ≥ 25 AND at least one affiliation at `trusted` tier (the
 * per-shelter coordinator sign-off carries into the platform tier).
 * Production rule per the Cold-Start Playbook is "real walks at any
 * participating shelter + ≥2 trainer vouches" — the demo substitutes the
 * trusted-affiliation check for the vouch count because vouch records
 * aren't modeled yet. ASSUMPTION A3 (portability is the load-bearing
 * claim; shelters may insist on per-shelter earning).
 *
 * All helpers are pure — dynamic state (WalkerApplications, Bookings)
 * is passed in by callers, matching the `getUserShelterAffiliations`
 * convention in lib/mockShelters.ts.
